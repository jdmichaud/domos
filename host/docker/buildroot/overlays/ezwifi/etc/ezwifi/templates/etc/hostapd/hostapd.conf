# Interface for separate control program. If this is specified, hostapd
# will create this directory and a UNIX domain socket for listening to requests
# from external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and
# configuration. The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so
# multiple hostapd processes/interfaces can be run at the same time if more
# than one interface is used.
# /var/run/hostapd is the recommended directory for sockets and by default,
# hostapd_cli will use it when trying to connect with hostapd.

# g = IEEE 802.11g (2.4 GHz), ad = IEEE 802.11ad (60 GHz); a/g options are used
# with IEEE 802.11n (HT), too, to specify band). For IEEE 802.11ac (VHT), this
# needs to be set to hw_mode=a. When using ACS (see channel parameter), a

# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.

# in wpa_key_mgmt.
