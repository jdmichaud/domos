    QtWebEngine integrates chromium's fast moving web capabilities into Qt.

    Our goal is to bring the latest and best implementation of the web platform
    into the universe of Qt. It is not just a port of the core HTML/CSS
    rendering engine, it is the entire Chromium platform. The integration with

    Qt focuses on an API that is easy to use, yet extensible. We also make no
    compromise on the graphics integration, integrating the layer rendering of
    Chromium directly into the OpenGL scene graph of QtQuick.
